    This module implements the GlobalLock class, providing
    interprocess locks within a server.

    A GlobalLock is implemented as a file in the /tmp/ directory,
    which is assumed to exist (on the current drive in Windows).

    A quick and easy way to use a blocking GlobalLock is as follows:

    with GlobalLock('somestring'):
